# Alando-Exchange
This is the repository for the The Alando Exchange Initiative. Website: alandoexchange.com

The Alando Exchange Resource Repository is a free and open library of materials designed to support students and mentors at every stage of the journey. Here, you’ll find FAQs, handouts, workshop materials, and other helpful resources to guide college readiness, networking, and career exploration. All resources are openly available to download and use—because we believe access to knowledge should be barrier-free.
